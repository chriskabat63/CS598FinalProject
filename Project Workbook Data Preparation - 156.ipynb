    "***Ensembling Classical Machine Learning and Deep Learning Approaches for Morbidity Identification from Clinical Notes ***\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract:  The main goal of the paper is to extract Morbidity from clinical notes.  The idea was to use a combination of classical and deep learning methods to determine the best approach for classifying these notes in one or more of 16 morbidity conditions.  These models used a combination of NLP techniques including embeddings and bag of words implementations.  It also measured the effect including of stop words.  Lastly, it used ensemble techniques to tie together a number of the classical and deep learning models to provide the most accurate results.\n",

    "Dataset was retrieved from the DBMI Data Portal, Department of Biomedical Informatics (DBMI) in the Blavatnik Institute at Harvard Medical School.  This dataset was originally created for the i2b2 Obesity Challenge conducted in 2008.\n",
    "This data was provided in XML format with a test and training set.  Along with the test and training set, labeled data of two forms were included. They were called Intuitive and Textual.  Textual judgements were derived by looking at the notes by multiple experts.  When the experts didn’t agree, a resident doctor annotated it with a Intuitive judgement.\n",
