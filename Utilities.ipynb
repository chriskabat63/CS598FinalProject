    "\n",
    "Abstract:  The main goal of the paper is to extract Morbidity from clinical notes.  The idea was to use a combination of classical and deep learning methods to determine the best approach for classifying these notes in one or more of 16 morbidity conditions.  These models used a combination of NLP techniques including embeddings and bag of words implementations.  It also measured the effect including of stop words.  Lastly, it used ensemble techniques to tie together a number of the classical and deep learning models to provide the most accurate results.\n",
